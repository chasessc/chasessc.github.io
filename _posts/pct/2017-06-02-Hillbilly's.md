*Shortly after sunrise*

I got up pretty early at my campsite (around 5am) and was looking forward to getting moving, as I knew my pace was slow and I wanted as many hours in the day as possible to walk and rest.  I had a quick breakfast, rounded out with a couple of Advil, and was on the trail and moving by 6am.  I had decided the best option was to try to get around 22 miles over the next day (ideally) or two (if my leg was hurting too badly), to the point where the PCT crossed Highway 10.  From there, I would try to hitch into Cabazon / Morongo Nation territory where guthook's told me there was a casino / hotel.  I'll resume my recovery there, and play blackjack while I wait to hopefully win back some money to pay for these additional hotel bills I wasn't planning on.  That was the day's plan when I set out.

The first bit of trail was once again the steep, rocky downhill that was destroying my body and spirits so badly yesterday, but at least today my leg had the benefit of being "fresh" for it as well as on Advil.  I could still feel that it was hurting, but it was back to the dull, throbbing pain rather than the cutting, thought-dominating pain it had reached last night.  In what seemed to truly be an act of mercy, the grade lessened before too long and a layer of soft duff swept across the trail. This really helped my progress, though it was not to last.  The trail again turned steeper, and rockier, but was nothing compared to the section I had come down the day before.  At one point, while focused on keeping weight off my left leg as much as possible and doing everything I could to reduce the strain on it - probably coupled with still being tired, and frustrated - I stumbled on a rock with my right foot and rolled my ankle pretty badly.  I actually collapsed over it as I felt it starting to roll, in order to avoid putting weight on it.  This meant I fell facefirst down on the trail, but as I did it looked like my ankle had rolled almost 90 degrees, so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't gotten the weight off of it I would have seriously injured it.  By some stroke of luck, I didn't seem to get so much as a bruise from my fall.  It did immediately put me back in my miserable mindset from yesterday, however, and I was near tears thinking about what an inexperienced asshole I am, how my lingering injury was now leading me to do more dumb things, and how horrible I would feel if I had to be rescued from this mountain - which seems like it would be quite a challenge.  In order to stay focused and motivated, I started berating myself under my breath.  "Come on, you stupid sack of shit.  Pay attention, what's wrong with you?  Focus, idiot".  Then I'd try some positive reinforcement. "Don't worry about it, you're just tired and in pain.  Just take one step at a time, look where you're going, you'll get there just fine even if it takes a while."  I don't know which was more effective, or if my reflecting on the ridiculousness of going all "Good Cop, Bad Cop" on myself was ultimately the most effective part of the whole exercise.   Something of an aside, but thinking about all this awful, rocky terrain made me think to myself that the wilderness really had it out for me.  Almost immediately, I regretted even thinking this, as it's clearly not the case.  The truth is that the wilderness is just totally indifferent and uncaring.

*Looking back, leaving the San Jacinto Wilderness - that means the hazardous conditions are over right?*

After about two miles, I made it out of the San Jacinto wilderness.  I continued walking, feeling ok physically but pretty down mentally.  In addition to thoughts of my own worthlessness, I had been thinking about the Jack London stories I'd read where men's hubris or carelessness sealed their fates, and it wasn't doing much to lift my mood.  I had also been thinking about the members of my little "trail family" that I've been leapfrogging with, and the fact that 1.) some of them were hitching some sections, when I wasn't, 2.) I was now moving slower than usual, and 3.) that I'd be taking at least one more zero likely would mean I wouldn't see any of them ever again - or at least for a good, long while.  Surprisingly to me, this was probably the thing that hit me the hardest.  We aren't even hiking together or anything, but I've really come to look forward to seeing them at breaks on the trail or in town and catching up, and the prospect of falling behind and not seeing them was now depressingly likely.  I tried to tell myself I'd find another trail family, but I have to say - I'm pretty attached to the group I've been moving up the trail with.

*The casino was visible for many miles as we wrapped our way down the hills, taunting me*

After several hours, I made it to the first water source, where a group of hikers were tearing down camp for a late start to the day.  As they set about leaving, I set about filtering water and having lunch, and heard multiple people shouting someone's name.  It turned out a girl from a party of four people was lost.  Not good, but at least she was with a group so there were people with her who were looking for her.  In talking with the group packing up camp, it was noted that I was hiking alone, and I joked that I was indeed, so if I got lost no-one would be screaming my name in the woods.  One of them replied, "not for about a month anyway."  Pretty true, and one of those things that should serve to keep you humble, cautious, and focused out here.  Informed to keep an eye out for a tall, brunette girl I finished filtering my water and having a snack.  As I was getting ready to head back to the trail (the locus of the shouting), I heard joyous shouts and it was clear the girl was found.  I have to say, I was a bit surprised no-one else down by the water seemed to have more than a passing concern for the girl.  I think there's some sense that you're responsible for yourself out here, and most people would end up putting themselves at risk from delaying their hike for too long.  That said, mostly I think it's just selfishness and desire not to be inconvenienced - no one wants to spend hours of their day looking for someone they don't even know who did something dumb (heard lots of grumbling about "how do you even get lost here?") and potentially have to go into town earlier than desired to do an additional resupply.  I was planning to head over to see if there was anything I could do after I got water, but I wasn't prepared to help comb the woods with my injured leg - I needed to get to town ASAP and going off-trail on potentially sketchy terrain seemed like it could easily just make me a second problem.  So, I was pretty thankful the whole situation was resolved before I even finished getting water.

As I got back to the point where the spur trail to the water met the PCT, I saw that the group was two girls (one now recovered) and none other than Jet and Mike (Mio and Bigfoot).  I was pretty happy to see them, as I thought they'd be long gone, and they told me the story of what happened.  Basically,  they were all planning to stop together at the water source, but the brunette girl was ahead and missed the water source.  She didn't realize for about a mile and a half, and they'd been there looking for her while she doubled back and eventually reunited with them.  After my little detour yesterday, I suppose I'm not in a great position to talk, but it seemed pretty dumb to me.  I always start each morning, and each departure from a water source, by determining how far it is to the next one.  Not only does this inform how much water I'll begin that stretch with, but it means I can use dead reckoning to figure out about how far I've gone and about how long I have left (time, primarily, but also distance) before I reach the next water source.  If I take a significant break (i.e. lunch), I'll check my actual mileage and recalibrate, but otherwise I just check about 10-15 minutes before the time I expect to cross the water source, and then as needed to guide myself in.  Missing a water source by a mile and a half before realizing it is almost inconceivable to me.  Not only would I be way off my expected time, but I'd be wondering why I had so little water left (I now drink water on a pretty religious hourly schedule, with bonus water allotted for Gatorade, hotter days, and - if relevant - making/cleaning up dinner).

Seeing them was pretty motivating, as it gave me hope that I might not be so far distanced from my trail family after all after my upcoming zero day(s?).  Shortly after that water stop, we entered the desert properly once again.  It's pretty remarkable that one side of the mountain is full of water and lush pine forests, only to pretty dramatically and rapidly transition to hot and arid on the other slope.  From here all the way down to the water faucet a few miles before Highway 10, it was nothing but downhill.  Actually, it was pretty much sloughing off elevation all day long, but this section was pretty consistently graded with switchbacks, and generally was not too rocky.  Every once in a while there was a section routed through, or over, some rocks - where I cursed the trail planner, or around a downed tree - where I cursed nature, but generally it was relatively easy on my leg and I was able to make decent time.  Not great time, but decent time.  

![Mile 200](/assets/img/posts/0602_200.jpg)
*Mile 200! (Honestly, on the trail, I care way less about these numbers and way more about miles for towns and water sources)*

![Mile 200.88](/assets/img/posts/0602_2008.jpg)
*A more official Mile 200 marker, around mile 200.88 according to half-mile's*

On the way down the trail, I also passed Forrest (who I think is now called Craigslist? I need to find out the story on that one), SnowWhite, and some other hiker all taking a break in the shade.  Another motivating moment, as they were definitely in what I would consider my extended trail family, and were - once again - people I didn't think I'd be seeing again for a while.

![A rock that looks like a dinosaur](/assets/img/posts/0602_dinorock.jpg)
*A rock that looks like an "A Land Before Time" dinosaur to me*

By mid-afternoon, I had reached the water faucet, and I drank about 3 liters while sitting on a rock there wondering what to do.  With my leg, it had taken me longer to get there than I'd hoped, and I wasn't sure I wanted to walk another hour or more to reach the highway, only to hope I could then hitch the 4.5 miles into town.  Now in an area with data, I took the opportunity to look at the rates at the casino hotel.  I figured it wouldn't be too expensive, seeing as - at least to my mind - it was some lame Native American casino in the middle of nowhere.  I figured wrong.  The cheapest room was $276 / night, which was way too rich for my blood.  I was only joking about winning at blackjack to make light of stopping, I wasn't actually thinking I'd go make half a grand in a night (in fact, I probably would have ended up making a $40 donation to the Morongo tribe).  I was beginning to think I'd just camp out by the water faucet and head to the highway early tomorrow morning.  I'd heard it was a hard hitch into town, but best case I'd be able to get one.  Worst case, I'd hobble the 4.5 miles into town and at least be able to finally get some rest.

As we were waiting there, Forrest, SnowWhite, and their friend were getting ready to head a little over a mile down the road, where they had arranged to get picked up by a trail angel.  On the way down the trail, I had been leapfrogging two other guys (Dennis and FinalCut), who had decided they were going to try to hitch up to Big Bear rather than walk in the desert anymore.  Again, I like the continuous footpath approach, but I at least understand theirs.  They are totally open about the fact that they aren't doing a thru-hike, and both of them are on a time-limited schedule.  As such, they've both decided to sample various portions of the PCT and hitch up ahead whenever they feel they've had enough of a taste of a particular region of hiking.  That I have no problem with, it's just not what I'm out here to do.  Though there was no room in the car Forrest, SnowWhite, and friend would be taking, Dennis got the number for a trail angel from them who was known for coordinating rides, and before long the three of us had a ride into town.

The road the water faucet is on is closed to traffic, so we hiked down about a mile to a gate where it becomes a publicly accessible road.  We had to wait there about an hour (which we knew we would), until Deb (a.k.a. Ice) picked us up.  Dennis had failed to mention on the phone that I was hoping to get to a motel or something where I could take a bath, so that wasn't really part of the plan.  I was happy just to get closer to town, and figured I'd work something out once there.  As it turned out, there's a new trail angel named "Hillbilly" who started housing thru-hikers a couple of months ago.  Dennis and FinalCut were planning on spending the night there before hitching out the next morning, and because Deb had other runs going in the opposite direction from any motel, that became my plan too.  I figured I'd spend the night there, see how I felt, and either stay another night, get back on the trail, or figure out how to get elsewhere.

Deb warned us about Hillbilly's initiation ritual, so we arrived at the house knowing that the first thing he'd expect you to do was have a beer and a shot of everclear with him.  Once we got to his house, it was clear that pretty much everyone there had had a beer, a shot, and then some (and probably and then something else).  He had a fridge full of bud light, and it was fair game for anyone so inclined, which was most everyone.  I think I counted at least four dogs, though at least one of them was actually a neighbor's dog who had somehow gotten into Hillbilly's fenced-off yard.  We had stopped at In-N-Out on the way to Hillbilly's, as seems to be the ritual, so the three of us were sitting at the dining room table eating (I had a double order of fries and a "veggie burger", just a bun and vegetables), and so got to soak in some sense of the house.  There were pictures and ornaments of big cats all over the place, along with tons of tchotchkes and photos of his family and relatives.  There was even an old Hammond organ in one corner.  It looked "very lived in" as they say, whoever *they* are.  He is also a smoker, so the whole house was filled with a faint cloud of cigarette smoke and the lingering, permeating scent of it.  Before long, Hillbilly appeared from somewhere, shirtless and in jean shorts, and told the three of us to grab a beer and join him in his office, to "come into his world."  Oh boy.  The whole vibe was a little weird to me, so I was a bit on edge, but the fact that there were so many other people there (including two I arrived with) and that other trail angels were comfortable enough with him to bring thru-hikers there helped put me a bit more at ease.

I declined to grab a beer, but did go into the office with the two other guys.  He started blasting The Doors, and began to pour shots as he asked if Deb had told us about this.  One of the others guys said yes, and he seemed legitimately disappointed the surprise had been ruined.  I said I'd given up drinking for the year, and he clearly did not approve of that answer.  I was still sort of on edge, and was worried it would upset him or make me think I was some sort of narc if I didn't, so I said alright fine, I'll have one shot - which I did, no chaser.  190 proof everclear is not something I've had for a long time, and it's just as I remembered it.  He pointed, almost proudly, to the almost empty handle of everclear as he remarked that he drinks a lot.

After the shots, Hillbilly started to pack a metal and wood pipe, which he was proud to say he'd had for 40 years.  He provided some instruction to the three of us about how to smoke from a normal pipe without a carb. (I don't know if I'm old, or old-school, but this was not news to me), primarily revolving around "just feather it, feather the top", referring to placing your fingers atop the pipe to restrict airflow.  It was good weed, though he certainly likes to extend it more than I ever would - stirring the bowl several times and culminating in taking resin hits.  I guess I'm just a spoiled, wasteful user but that's the sort of thing I tend to avoid.  Regardless, it was a good time, and I learned at least one new trick, and I love The Doors - so all was good.  He began regaling us with tales of his time in the US Army, where - from what I remember - he was a sniper with something on the order of 76 confirmed kills, eventually serving in some sort of creme de la creme squad that technically didn't exist.  He talked about how they had to carry 100+ lb. backpacks doing 8 minute miles in the sand, how heavy his pack was because he had his rifle, sniper rifle, handgun, ammo for all three, and was a field medic so he had all the field medic gear as well.  Eventually, and unclear to me exactly how or when, he ended up working as a narcotics agent.  I'm not sure if this was still with the Army, or - judging from one news clipping he showed us - it could have been with the FBI, but it struck me as funny.  I didn't say anything, but here we were getting high with a man who was almost proudly an alcoholic, who had a career in busting people for drugs.  It got a little weird to me when "The End" came on, conjuring up images of Apocalypse Now as a part of me felt I was sitting there talking to a real-life Colonel Kurtz.

Those paranoid thoughts were short-lived, however.  In between talking about military things, and how dennis is sinned backwards, and other tidbits of knowledge, he revealed that his wife died in December.  It seems to be that Hillbilly, Dennis, is just a man in pain.  It is clear he loved his wife dearly, and regrets making life - to paraphrase him - a pain in the ass for her sometimes, and that his career meant he spent a lot of time away from her (seeing her, he said, only one or two weekends a month).  I suspect that he probably started taking in hikers to help distract himself from sinking into depression thinking about his wife, and to stave off loneliness as a revolving door of new, primarily young people come through providing a new audience for his stories.  A good number of veterans seem to hike the trail, including at least three who were there the night I was, so I think he's also able to easily find common ground with those hikers.  Looking around at the family photos, big cats memorabilia, and womanly touches her presence is still obvious in the house.  After things calmed down, two cats also appeared from his bedroom, which I strongly suspect were really his wife's love more than his.  As I looked around in this mindset, it seems he's really trying - to just keep going after years of life lived with and loving someone else, shouldering the burden of everything his wife must have done while alive.  Hopefully, his relationship with us thru-hikers proves to be a symbiotic one.
