Well, it's finally about to get real.  After several (at times frantic) months of preparation, I'm starting my thru-hike attempt of the PCT tomorrow morning - hopefully bright and early.  I spent most of last night doing final preparation and packing, and just finished up repacking after buying some miscellaneous items I was still missing (new lighters, tums, smartwater bottles, tape) I'm feeling pretty ready.  Honestly, for some time now I've mostly wanted to be through with all the planning and just out on the trail.  I think it's going to be the best thing to relieve me of some of my nervousness, and is the only thing that will really help me begin getting confident and tweaking anything that needs tweaking. 

It's getting late now though, and I'd like to have an early morning, so here's a few pictures instead of more words:
