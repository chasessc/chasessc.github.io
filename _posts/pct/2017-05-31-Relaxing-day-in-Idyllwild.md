Today I got to explore the town of Idyllwild a bit more, and I must say I'm pretty in love with it.  It's just a great little town, with lots of little shops and very friendly, happy people.  I could easily picture myself living in one of the cabins nestled in the pines on the outskirts of town.  Fortunately, my leg is feeling quite a bit better, so I'm going to push on before I get sucked into the vortex.

I started the day by heading to the outfitter, to see about getting some new shoes.  They actually carry the Altra Lone Peaks (my current shoe, that I'm quite fond of), but unfortunately didn't have them in the clown-shoe size 14 that I need, so no dice.  We then decided to try some new inserts, to get some arch support until I get new shoes.  I tried on the sample and they felt great! Oh yeah, this will work for me - only again they didn't have any for sale in my clown shoe size.  Not looking great for my feet.  I briefly considered trying to overnight some shoes here, but it would slow me down at least half a day, which I didn't really want to do.

I went and had an early lunch at the vegan place, having some local french press coffee, a fruity smoothie, and a tempeh reuben.  Everything was really good, but it cost me almost as much as my giant salad and huge, loaded pizza from across the parking lot last night - and was not nearly as filling.  Still, glad to have visited.  It's been my experience that a lot of vegan places have a sort of strange aloofness, where everyone working there seems sort of "bobbleheady" - sort of drifting along in clouds with no concern for prompt service or even necessarily acknowledging customers.  I've felt it with other vegan places, too, where there seems to be the regular / in-crowd that they're happy to see and everyone else they could just take or leave.  I don't really get it, and I think it's a pretty unfortunate trend.  It's not like anyone was unpleasant or anything, just this weird sort of detached "bobbleheadedness" I mentioned.

I went to the grocery store and got some more junk for my travels and the remainder of my stay - gatorade, apples, foot powder, baby wipes, toothpaste, and more epsom salts for another foot bath - before picking up my package at the post office.  The guy there was pretty funny, and very friendly, and now I have my food to sort through for the next leg of my journey.  I schlepped my package and grocery bag back to my room, and set out again on the search for new shoes or insoles.  I didn't have any luck at the shoe store in town, so I returned to the outfitter to see if I could just buy the sample pair of insoles.  The woman there was a little reluctant at first, but then said sure and gave me $10 off on them, bringing them in line with what they would have cost on amazon new.  All these remote, little stores definitely have some markup, but I'm pretty happy to have some new insoles as my arches were really becoming a source of discomfort.  Hopefully this will solve the problem until I get some new shoes.  I also picked up some adhesive knit, as a substitute for leukotape since I ran out, and some more body glide to replace the tube of skin glide I've just about finished (chafe is the enemy).  My dad also included a really nice metal tag, featuring one of "Los Dichos," "poco a poco se anda lejos".  Very appropriate, and incidentally around the time of my "I do move steady" rhyme I had actually been thinking of this saying - though I misremembered it, or was thinking of some variation of it, as I was thinking, "poco a poco se llega all√≠".  I got a little keyring at the hardware store, so it's now attached to my shoulder pocket zipper.

I saw Thor, Bigfoot, and Butterfly wandering through town on one of my trips and talked to them for a bit.  Bigfoot (not Mike, this is another one  - original name, eh?) and his girlfriend were really nice.  I'd passed them on the trail days earlier when they were taking a break, but just powered on past and didn't get a chance to talk to them.  I also saw the Rooster/Woodchuck group in town, and when I was getting back to my room I saw Jet, Lauren (SnowWhite), and Forrest getting ready to take off.  I was amazed they were here, as at least Jet was taking a zero in Warner Springs when I left, but they're among the skippers - they hitched from Paradise Valley Cafe into Idyllwild.  HYOH. HYOH. HYOH.  (It's all I can do to stop myself from yelling out "Shame!" as they walk past, Game of Thrones style).

I also didn't realize just how tired I had become.  I threw on some California Reggae (stuff like Slightly Stoopid, Rebelution) and slept pretty much all afternoon.  Once I got up, I ate the rest of that delicious pizza and now I've just been catching up on these blog posts.  It's approaching "hiker midnight" (9pm), so I'm just about ready to soak my feet in Epsom Salt bath #2, sort out my food situation, repack my pack, and head to bed so I can get an early start tomorrow.
