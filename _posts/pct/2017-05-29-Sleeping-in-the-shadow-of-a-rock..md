I made today an exceptionally easy day.  After my long day yesterday, and not really getting situated for sleep until 10pm at the earliest, I had just decided that I wasn't going to set an alarm or anything and just get up whenever I wanted.  My plan - which I followed - was to hike only a few miles to the next water source and hang out there during the middle of the day to avoid hiking in the worst of the heat.  I've pretty much decided to try hard to do what I actually think is the best strategy, namely, *not* hiking in the middle of the day.  It sounds simple, but especially as a habitual late-riser, it's a hard adjustment to get up early to get some early hiking hours in.  The second hard part of the equation, which other hikers I've talked to share, is the discipline to sit for hours in the middle of the day - it's really hard to sit still rather than hiking.

Anyway, today I forced myself to actually do it, aided by the fact that I knew it would have been about 30 miles to get all the way to Idyllwild anyway, so I was pretty content to just split it into two days.  I got to the junction with the spur trail down to the water source, and had one little surprise - the trail was quite steep, quite narrow, and full of loose rocks.  It's not like this should have been an unknown, I just haven't been very good about actually looking at the topo maps and/or hiker comments on stops.  Mostly, I've just been guided by distance between good water sources, and accept whatever terrain ends up being in between.  Related, on the PCT I've started to feel like there are generally two truths about what it will do in any given day.  1.)  If you're looking ahead, wondering where the PCT will go, the answer is probably "whichever way goes up the highest", and 2.) on any given day, the answer to what you'll be doing is most likely "climbing and descending, repeatedly".  As such, and since I'm not yet at a point where conditions (read: snow) make it impossible to follow the trail, I haven't really concerned myself with mapping out specifically when the ascents and descents will occur, instead simply relying on the inevitability that they will indeed occur.

Early on in the day, I was passed by Rick (Drifthead) and Ghost, who looked suspiciously well-laundered.  It turned out they had hitched from Highway 74 -> Paradise Valley Cafe -> Idyllwild, and then back to Highway 74 to resume the trail.  I think if you need a break, hitching ahead and then back so you don't miss a section of the trail is a pretty good option.  They recommended Silver Pines Lodge in Idyllwild for when I get there, we shared a bit of news / gossip about various hikers we knew (this is primarily how updates on people travel), and they hustled on down the trail ahead of me faster than I was willing to go.  Lacking a trail name yet, my thoughts sometimes turn to names I would give myself, and one of them is "MrSlowAndSteady" (or, possibly, "CaptainSlowAndSteady" as an allusion to Top Gear's James May, and because who wants to simply be a mister when you can be a captain).  In a similar vein is "TheTortoise", because I tend to get passed by people only to later pass them while they're taking long rests while I keep shuffling my way down the trail.  Other ones could be "BTWImVegan" (sort of a common joke, but it's come up a surprising amount on the trail - eating out, declining food / hiker box options, and as the reason for my mailed-resupply, no-cook strategy.  No one's been a dick about it, which is nice.  In fact, most people are just impressed I'm sticking to a vegan diet while on the trail, and I've even gotten to have a few discussions about why I'm vegan, why I avoid down, etc.  Another obvious ones are "Gatorade" or "OrangeJar", because I keep my food soaking jar (an old gatorade powder jar) strapped to the back of my pack.  "PurplePack" for the very obvious reason that my pack is purple.  After I did my first night hiking, I thought something like "NightMiles" would be cool - but I'd have to keep up the nighthiking for that to make any sense.  Basically, when you're walking down the trail you have lots of time to think about all sorts of things - inane and otherwise.  Aside from humming or singing random song fragments, another one of my pastimes has becoming making stupid little rhymes up to amuse myself.  

Exhibit A:
*My name is Sam,*
*I've got blisters on my feet,*
*I do not eat meat,*
*My pack's kind of heavy,*
*Yet I move steady*

The last line must be really belted/growled out for maximum effect - think Robin Williams singing "but I'm a mammal" in [The Batty Rap](https://g.co/kgs/ofGBB0) from Fern Gully.  Real quality stuff, in other words.

Most people simply dropped their packs at the head of this ~1/4 mile downhill, "ankletwister" of a trail, but since I was planning on spending a good chunk of time down there I just sighed and carefully worked my way down it.  At the end of the trail it leveled out and emerged into a clearing with a spring-fed water trough.  Not only was the water flowing in clear and cold, but - in contrast with the reports I had read - it did not have any sort of sulfur smell.  I filtered and drank a liter immediately, and then set up my tent in the "fast fly" setup for the first time.  It's a pretty cool feature of my tent - basically, you can just use the groundcloth, the poles, and the rain fly to create a covered / shady spot without bothering to set up the tent proper.  I was pretty happy with it, though the lightweight aspect struck again a bit.  The rain fly does create some shade, but it definitely is not thick enough to block out all the sun.

I caught up on blog posts while sitting in the relative shade of the fast fly shelter. *Aside: I've started creating stub posts with bulletpoints I want to talk about, and going back to flesh them out when I have time.  This helps me avoid forgetting the interesting things from a day, lets me tag the location properly, and means I don't fret about delaying writing a post if I'm just totally exhausted or get in late.*  Took a few little naps, including elevating my feet for periods (and definitely having my socks and shoes off).  There were a lot of butterflies down by the trough, and some weird proto-hummingbird insect that had a long proboscis that seemed most useful for getting nectar.  Also a number of bumblebees, which I always like to see.  Also a number of large horse flies, which I don't like to see.  When I arrived, they ignored me, resting on the lip of the water trough - I posit they had been busy sucking the blood out of some poor creature, and were now too busy digesting to bother with me.  As I sat in the fast fly, a huge number of flies did begin to find my shady spot, but they were just hanging out up at the top not biting me so I figured no harm, no foul - you guys do you.  Plus, it would have been an exercise in futility to try to kill them all.  Life is pretty cheap and short-lived as a fly, and there were no shortage of them.

While hanging out down there, I got to play Walmart greeter a bit.  I was kind of surprised more people didn't come by, as it was the best water source for miles around, but I think it was due to some combination of people just loading up on water at Paradise Valley Cafe before hitching back to the Highway 74 trailhead, and losers just opting to skip this whole section of the trail (more on that later).  While there I did see Rooster, Woodchuck, and Pheidippides.  Their other friend, Airmail, had hitched ahead to Idyllwild.  Now that I know the origins of the two friends names, I guess I should explain them.  Early on in their hike, Airmail and Pheidippides were both carrying packs that were somewhere north of 60 lbs (I think possibly as heavy as 90 lbs is what was said).  Unsurprisingly, on the hot, uphill stretch into Mount Laguna that was one of my least favorite days of hiking Airmail suffered from heat stroke.  After giving him water and setting up a tarp to provide him shade, and lacking cell signal, Pheidippides dropped his pack and ran all the way into Mount Laguna to get help.  Help came in the form of a helicopter from Mount Laguna to take the now-named Airmail to safety, where he was given fluids and monitored for several hours.  Another happy outcome for what could have been a really bad situation.  The heat is no joke out here, no doubt made worse when carrying such a huge pack.  Fortunately, both of them had pack shakedowns in Mount Laguna and shed a ton of weight.  For those, like me, who weren't aware - Pheidippides was the man who ran from Marathon to Athens (approximately 26 miles) to report victory over the Persians.  It also would have been really hot during his run.  He also died at the end.  Thankfully, *this* Pheidippides is still alive, well, and on-trail.

A while later Katie passed through to get water before carrying on.  I continued hanging out in the shade for a while, drinking lots of water, and decided to have dinner before leaving.  Having dinner by a water source is nice for two reasons - first, it means I don't have to carry water for dinner and dinner cleanup with me; second, it means I don't have food smells anywhere near where I'm camping.  After hanging out down there for almost six hours, I finally got back on the trail shortly before 5pm.  Let me tell you, I've gotten stronger.  That nasty climb up, while difficult, was met with an attitude of "whatever, it's just got to be done."  When I first started, I think the attitude would have been more "oh jesus, lord, why? What sadist made this path?" interspersed with numerous panting breaths.  I found a glove about a third of the way up that looked suspiciously like one of Katie's, and grabbed it.  I've grabbed several other things along the trail, most of which I've managed to return to their rightful owners further on down the trail.

At this point, I'd like to talk more about this section, and why it wasn't so populated.  The section of the trail between Highway 74 and Idyllwild is interrupted by a closure due to a bad fire in 2013.  Much of the trail has been re-opened, but in order to get into Idyllwild you still have to take a detour down a dirt road, along another dirt road under some powerlines, along the highway, and along a couple other small roads to walk into Idyllwild.  As such, many people just decided "to hell with it" and opted to hitch from Paradise Valley Cafe into Idyllwild.  This is similar to the earlier people who saw the Trough Water at Sunrise Trailhead and noped out of there to Julian rather than walking through the desert into Scissor's Crossing.  Lots of people also seem to have no problems getting rides through Idyllwild rather than walking to the trailhead.

I, personally, just don't understand it.  Though I know with my late start date, pace thus far, and year, it may be unlikely to actually get all the way to Canada, I want to be able to say without caveats that whatever section I hiked, I hiked the *entire* thing.  If I'm fortunate enough to make it to Manning Park in Canada, I want to be able to say in completely honesty, "I hiked from Mexico to Canada."  To me, these people would be lying if they claim that, and cheapen the effort of those who actually do that.  You hiked most of the way from Mexico to Canada, probably even the vast majority of the way, so why cheapen it by skipping 20 miles or so along the way when you're planning to walk on the order of 2650 miles?  It just makes no sense to me, but I guess that's why the mantra is Hike Your Own Hike (HYOH), not hike Sam's hike.  At least I'm not alone in my thinking.  Though I feel like we're in the minority, there are others out there who are adherents to the "continuous footpath" school of thought - maintaining an uninterrupted hiked path all the way through the journey.  So far the only others I know who are doing this are Katie, Rooster, Woodchuck, and Pheidippides.  (Ok, so maybe I can't claim to have walked "from Mexico" without a caveat either - the trail starts in Campo, CA, USA, not Mexico, but I did my damnedest, beginning my hike by walking to the border wall and sticking my arm through.  The border wall is probably set back enough from the actual border that I didn't actually get my arm all the way to Mexico, but without pretty extreme effort that's about the best you can do).

The other reason I don't understand people skipping sections is that you just miss out on some of the experiences.  I present the following pictures as proof, including my first 360 panorama.  I have no idea how well it will display on the page.  Every day I'm out here, especially at the peaks, I just feel so good and so happy to be able to be out here doing this.  One of the "deeper thoughts" I keep mulling over as I walk along is how I would explain why I'm doing this to a young child.  It specifically takes the form of a young girl, because in Mount Laguna I was talking to a couple with a young girl about my trip thus far, and she was very shy, but also quite visibly excited about the idea of the hike - ever since I keep thinking about how I could explain it to her specifically, to really sell it.  I have a pretty good idea of what I'd say now, but it's something I'll write up later because I'd really like to take time to "do it right" rather than having it be in this freewheeling style of my posts.  I think having experience from sections other than the desert would also help make it a more complete and accurate answer.

I also realized I didn't actually explain the title of this post.  I only hiked about 10 miles today, leaving about 20 miles to get into Idyllwild tomorrow because it was getting late, I had decided to take an easy day, and it didn't look like there was likely to be another campsite for a while.  The campsite I found was a little sketchy.  It was downhill off the trail a bit through some brush, in a small clearing next to a little cave formed between two giant boulders.  After sweeping my headlamp to the very back of the cave to make sure it wasn't being used by any creature, I set up in the clearing with a giant boulder towering over me.
