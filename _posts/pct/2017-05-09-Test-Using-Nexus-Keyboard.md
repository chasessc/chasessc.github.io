If this keyboard isn't too heavy, I'm totally going to take it.  I was looking at getting a USB OTG keyboard, but honestly - I don't want to spend *any* more money on things that aren't absolutely essential at this point.  I'll head downstairs and weigh this thing in a second.  If it isn't too heavy, I think I'm probably going to be taking it because it will definitely let me write longer posts!  It may be too heavy though, now that I think about it - it does have a series of magnets in the back... the downfall of things that aren't designed to be light-weight.
