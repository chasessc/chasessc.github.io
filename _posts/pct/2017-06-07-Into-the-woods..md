*Another partial post re-written due to my keyboard disconnecting, sigh.  I don't know if it's the keyboard, or the phone, but it sucks having to rewrite things.  It's also incredible how when it disconnected and reconnected, my useless broken phone managed to select what I had written, delete it, and save - preventing me from using "undo" to restore what I had written.  When people act like phones are capable of replacing PCs, this sort of thing (to say nothing of their limited power, screen space, and functionality) makes me laugh.*

So, today didn't start off so great either.  I woke up to my right ankle feeling very stiff, and with some pain if I walked on it in any way that caused it to point inward or outward at all.  I decided today would be a good day to throw on my nice, light-weight, long-sleeved ExOfficio shirt as my arms were beginning to get burnt, I had experienced a little nipple chafe yesterday (and learned I am carrying the world's most useless, non-adhesive knock-off BandAids), and my T-shirt was starting to reek pretty badly.  As I pulled my long-sleeved shirt out of the stuff sack, I noticed a stain near the buttons I didn't remember, and then saw that the pocket said "L.L. Bean".  Damn it all.  When I did laundry at Hillbilly's, clearly FinalCut and I ended up swapping shirts.  Not only is mine nicer, and lighter, but it's also a size XL and his is a M.  Awesome.  Frustrated, I put on my rank T-shirt for yet another day in the sun.  Maybe the smell will keep the bears away.

I'm embarrassed to admit just how quickly my thoughts turned negative.  I began to start thinking FinalCut had taken my shirt intentionally because it was nicer (and that M couldn't possibly have fit him well, he was not a small guy).  He *knew* he was hitching up to Big Bear while I took zeroes, and *knew* I basically couldn't contact him.  I started thinking all sorts of negative things about him, extrapolating wildly from what little interaction I had with him.  I hate this sort of revelation, but as I thought back to it throughout the day, it certainly was a revelation.  What I realized is that I have a really hard time dealing with unexpected hiccups caused by carelessness that *I could have avoided*.  Ultimately, the blame has to lie with me for not ensuring that the shirt I had actually packed was the right one - and for all I know FinalCut is up the trail cursing me out for having his favorite L.L. Bean shirt.  I'm much more able to accept negative situations where I couldn't have affected the outcome, or where I was aware of what was going on at the time, but this sort of thing is hard for me.  Mostly, it's just me being really frustrated with myself for not paying close attention, but the best I'm able to do is recognize that and shove the paranoid, negative thoughts into the deep recesses of my mind - never truly getting rid of them.  I know that if, somehow, I have another interaction with FinalCut where something goes wrong, these same, stupid thoughts will jump out of the cobwebbed areas of my brain as if to say, "Ah hah! I knew you were no good!"

Today was also a hot day, but it was not nearly as bad as yesterday.  Most of the trail was downhill, and a lot of it was through fairly wooded areas that offered a bit of shade.  The difference in temperature when in the shade versus when in the sun is pretty staggering - it is the difference between sweating standing still, and getting chilled after more than a moment's pause.

I leapfrogged with several groups today, which was sort of nice.  I have no real desire to hike *with* anyone, but it is nice to know that there are other people out there on the trail, and maybe even have a little conversation with them.  My adductor muscle was again giving me just the slightest bit of pain, a dull pain that didn't slow me down at all but made me fearful of overdoing it.  I again - and earlier in the day - developed bad arch pain, as well as a stronger pain in my right ankle.  None of this made me feel great, and it always moves my focus when hiking away from an inner dialogue and happy thoughts to dealing with the pain and fear of hurting myself more.

A short while after one of several breaks I took, in an effort to reduce the pain I was feeling, I stumbled across a big, painted dumpster and a couch.  Trail. Magic.  I had even heard about this, but I never knew exactly where it was, and totally forgot about it when I actually was approaching it.  The dumpster was full of soda, emergency food, information about Big Bear (including some history), and some contributions by hikers in the form of post-cards and poems.  I chugged a store-brand Cola, and carried on my way, as I had just taken a break not 10 minutes earlier.  I wish I'd remembered about the couch, because it would have been a nicer place to stop than the root I rested on.

It really is impressive how much a little magic can change your mood.  I felt totally reinvigorated, both by the soda (caffeine, what?), but also just by the show of support and a bit of novelty as the hike was becoming painful and monotonous.  This high carried me for almost an hour before the pain began to return.

Toward the end of the day, it did start to get quite pretty.  It was mostly nice, wooded areas with plenty of water around, and I stopped at the last such stream crossing to get water and have dinner.  After my 15ish mile day out of Cabazon, I realized I wasn't going to get to Big Bear today anyway, so I decided to take it easy and just stop at a campsite just uphill of the stream rather than pressing on a few miles in pain.  I think I actually made about 17 miles, so it wasn't terribly short, just not particularly long either.

It felt really good to take an easy day.  I set up my camp in daylight, and had several hours to just relax before it got dark and cool and I needed to get to sleep.  I sorted some pictures and wrote one blog post, and then let myself be lulled to sleep by the burbling of the nearby stream.
