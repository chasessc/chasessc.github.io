I don't really have much to say about today.  I basically sat around, slept, watched shitty TV, and generally wished I was somewhere more interesting.  Banning is not a very interesting town - about the only things I could have gone and done were gambling at a nearby hotel, or watching a movie at the theatre.  The latter actually sounded like a reasonably good way to kill time, but I took a nap and ended up sleeping too late to do that.

The only thing enjoyable about this town is something I love about time spent in any town - pigging out.  Yesterday, I went across the street to a little Mexican place with "authentic Mexican."  After struggling for a bit to determine whether their beans were made with lard, or the rice had butter or anything in it, I had two "California burritos".  They were fairly large, and - I'm pretty sure - fairly inauthentic Mexican.  Each one had rice, beans, french fries, guacamole, and a handful of other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting.  When the waitress asked if I wanted the second one to go and I said I wanted it for there, she was definitely a little shocked.  Tonight, I had an entire large Pizza Hut pizza (better than I remembered it being) loaded down with veggies, a thing of cinnamon sticks for dessert, and a liter of Mountain Dew to polish it all down.  You really do just develop this incredible, strong hunger and I'm taking full advantage of the fact that for once in my life I'm actually probably burning enough calories to warrant eating like this.  If I could get away with it in normal life without becoming a balloon, I totally would.
