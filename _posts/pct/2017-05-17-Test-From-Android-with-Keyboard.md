Thanks to my sister, I have a pretty light-weight keyboard to take with me on my trip.  Just testing it out, making sure everything about it works as intended, yadda yadda.  Also stole / modified a little script to generate the initial posts so I can have date, title, etc. populated so that I don't have to deal with putting it in myself everytime.  Next post should be the first real post!
