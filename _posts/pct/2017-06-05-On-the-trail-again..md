Today started off well enough.  I packed up the few things I hadn't already, and ordered a Lyft.  On a whim the night before, I had checked to see if Lyft even existed out here - to my pleasant surprise, it did.  A taxi would have cost around $70, before any tip.  My Lyft was around $25, with the tip.  I had considered trying to get a ride from a trail angel (indeed, it's the only reason I created a facebook account), but I couldn't shake the feeling of it being an imposition - not only was I a little off the beaten path, but I was alone, so it would be a ride for one person.  Also, I wasn't entirely committed to getting back on the trail - I wanted to be able to decide when I woke up whether I was feeling well enough to or thought I should ~~rot~~ recover in Banning for another day.

Joshua, my Lyft driver, was a friendly guy.  As we talked about the PCT, he told me he'd pray for me.  I wasn't surprised, seeing as he had some self-help looking religious book on the dash, and thanked him.  I don't hold any stock in prayer myself, but it was clear he did; I just take it as him saying he'll be thinking of me, and hoping I don't meet any misfortune, and appreciate the sentiment.  He also told me I should consider working for Lyft after I finished my hike if I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, and went into a fair bit of detail about their car leasing program for drivers.  Joshua is not the first person to tell me I should consider working for Lyft, and some of those suggestions came when I was still full-on business mode.  I wonder if I just look like a man who has no plan, or if people just really enjoy working for Lyft.  None of them ever had anything like a code they were trying to push on me for any sort of referral.

After about 20 minutes, I was back at Snow Creek Rd., where I had departed the trail.  It's about the only time in my life I've ordered a ride, and requested that the driver go right past where I'd be heading so I could walk back to it.  I began my walk anew, feeling pretty good and pain-free.  The only problem is the walk out of Cabazon is just boring as all hell.  It began as a path along the road, that quickly turned into a sandy mess, often times lacking any clear definition.  If you've ever walked in sand, you know it's more challenging, and there wasn't even a beach or anything here to make it pretty or to serve as a reward.  Just the hot sun beating down upon you as you trudge through sand.  The closest thing to a reward was reaching the train bridge.

After more slogging along through sand, under the hum of high-voltage powerlines, and past discarded TVs, I eventually began to slowly climb out of Cabazon and up a hill in the Morongo reserve.  Again, this was not a particularly interesting hill.  After some miles of this walking, which just felt like escaping Cabazon, I made it to a somewhat ominous gate warning of Wind Turbines.  Directly past that, there was a nice sign welcoming hikers to Section C.  The structure the sign was attached to seemingly used to serve as a bulletin board, but when I got there all that was left was a hole-ridden piece of glass with the note, "Nice Job, Asshole" scrawled on it in sharpie.  Message board or not, I had read that the Mesa Wind Farm was located a short ways past, and maintained a nice cache for hikers.

As I got closer, I followed the signs to get to "Shade and Water", and soon arrived at a small, manufactured building below hills covered in wind turbines.  First, I went to a shaded spot and found nothing there - but I had read during their office hours hikers were welcome to come in for water, so I did.  Let me tell you, Mesa Wind Farm is a gem out there.  I had brought 4 liters of water, and was tearing through it at a pretty alarming heat.  When I arrived at the Wind Farm, it was probably around 11am, and it was up to 98 F with a breeze no stronger than a whisper.  They had a refrigerator full of giant jugs of pre-mixed Gatorade and bottled water.  I downed a few glasses of Gatorade, refilled my water, and enjoyed having a moment in air conditioning.  It was really restoring.  I asked a few questions about the wind turbines, as I noticed many of them weren't spinning (despite being directly next to one that was), and I was curious if the breeze really varied that much or if they were disabled.  The majority of the wind turbines at this Wind Farm were from the 80's, and are fixed-pitched, so many of them were just not running at the time.  For some of the others, there really just wasn't enough of a breeze that day to do anything (no real shocker, given how still it was when I was hiking nearby).  They also seemed pretty knowledgeable about the trail, and were even giving a couple I saw sitting in the shade outside a ride into town - as the husband was suffering badly from the heat and they thought it unwise to continue.  Just really nice people.

As I left the air conditioned bliss of Mesa, I knew I needed something to elevate my mood, and for the first time I decided to listen to some music while I walked.  I'd previously avoided it as I was worried about rattlesnakes, my battery life, and was just enjoying hearing everything around me - but this was some of the most boring hiking I've done on the entire trail.  I threw on a bunch of Rebelution and Slightly Stoopid, and it helped propel me up and down the hills that started to develop.

Some miles later, I made it to a junction of the PCT and a trail to the Whitewater Preserve.  The Whitewater Preserve had previously been a trout farm, but now is a conservancy that allows day-use and is particularly welcoming to PCT hikers.  I decided to take the approximately mile-long (round-trip) detour to the Preserve, because it sounded cool, meant I'd be able to take a break from the oppressive sun, and meant I could get water without having to filter it (one of my small joys of on-trail life, filtering water can get quite tedious).  The Whitewater Preserve easily lived up to its reputation.  I was impressed by just how pretty it was, and enjoyed chugging lots of water and taking a nap in the shade.  I even went over to the wading pool, and lounged about giving my feet some much-needed relief.  I had dinner and, tempting though it was to stay, decided I should really try to make more than the approximately 10 miles I had gone to reach this point.  As I was packing up, a man truck-camping approached me and started talking my ear off about hiking, camping, gear, and so on.  After a while, I tried pretty hard and pretty obviously to make it clear I was trying to do my own thing and get moving, but he didn't pick up on it at all.  Oh well, throwing a backpack on and walking away serves as a pretty unignorable statement of intentions.

Shortly after I began walking again, my arches started to absolutely kill me.  The day had a large amount of climbing, and by the end I was really feeling pretty bad.  My adductor was beginning to have a dull pain again, my arches (as stated) were killing me, and my right ankle was definitely still stiff and sensitive.  I began to question whether I left too early from Banning, but I really couldn't stand to sit there another day.  The time, the expense, the boredom - I just did not want to be there.  It does make me worry for what I'll do from here if the pain doesn't go away.  I'm not sure how much time I'm willing to spend off-trail recovering before just calling it, but I'm pretty sure it's not very long, and walking when in pain just sucks all the joy out of it for me.

I only made it about 15 miles, but I did have a gorgeous campsite.  Hopefully I feel better tomorrow.
