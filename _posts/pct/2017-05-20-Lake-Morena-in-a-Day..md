*Lake Morena*

I can't recall being as happy in recent memory as when I crested the hill and saw that view down to Lake Morena, knowing it was all downhill from there.  After having a blissful first 15 miles, where I was just so happy to be on the trail and chugging along, the last five miles of climb into Lake Morena was pretty damn tough for me.  I had been hiking 10-15 miles with about every other day at something between a 3.2-3.6mph pace, but due to a lack of time never with a pack.  Let me tell you, having 30lbs. on your back changes your opinion of distance and - particularly- elevation.  There were times near the end of the day where I'd check my watch to figure out my distance traveled through dead reckoning, only to check what felt like 10 or even 20 minutes later only to see that only a few minutes had elapsed.

That said, it was really pretty for most of the hike.  Saw three rattlesnakes, including my first one right by mile 1.  Thankfully, he had the courtesy to slither off the trail the second he saw me.  The other two...not so much.  One was coiled up, rightly pissed off, and didn't move until he'd made it clear that it was his home and we were the interlopers.

I'm planning to take it a little easier today, since I'm a bit tired, and it's a long climb to Mount Laguna from here.  I'll probably do 10-15 miles today, and finish up whatever I don't climb today tomorrow.  Yesterday I stopped at Hauser Creek before the final climb and took a little nap.  I was beginning to get some blisters too, so I cleaned my feet and put some leukotape on which seems to have stopped the issue entirely.  What they say about leukotape seems to be true!  While sitting there in the cool shade of the ~banana~ tree, the Phish song (Fee?) came to mind, and humming that to myself for a while kept me feeling pretty relaxed and really happy.  "Trying to live a live that's completely free."

There's a lot more people on the trail that I expected, mostly because I figured I would be at the tail end and most people would be weeks ahead of me, so that's nice - good to know that even when you don't see anyone for long stretches there's likely someone not far away.  I'm still trying to figure out my own pace and stuff, so I didn't really want to start hiking with anyone just yet, which probably caused me to be a little anti-social (shocker).  Mostly it was just "hellos" to people, though for the last couple of miles I talked on and off with this one dude as we both slowly made our way down to Lake Morena.  Once I figure out my pace and get acclimated to the trail, I think I'll get a bit more social, but for now it's pretty nice to just do exactly what I want and not have to worry about slowing anyone down, getting slowed down, or coordinating when to stop.  If I want to stop right now, I just do.  Rock providing some shade? Good time for a break and a snack.

I haven't felt particularly hungry yet - in fact, I couldn't even finish my rice & beans last night so the second half of it became part of breakfast today.  I imagine that will change as "hiker hunger" sets in, but from what I gather that will take several weeks.

Another thing I should talk about is my nervousness and anxiety about the trail. In the week or so leading up to my start date, my stomach started really bothering me - feeling all twisted up into knots.  I honestly thought it must have been something I ate, or my lack of sleep, because I wasn't feeling nervous or anxious at all, just expectant (or so I thought).  The morning I started, I was just undeniably anxious as I repacked my pack, printed out the water report, and once more stopped to reflect on what an undertaking this is.  When my dad and I arrived at the Southern Terminus, I took a solid ten minutes just standing around soaking it all in, looking at the border wall, the trailhead, the monument - shit, this is happening.  I was really worried I'd do something stupid (like roll my ankle), forget something important (like my water filter), or have some awful luck (like getting bitten by a rattlesnake).  After waiting for a group to clear away from the monument, taking a couple pictures, and signing the register, I was out of there - and so was all my anxiety, it immediately just became about appreciating the experience, budgeting water, and finally doing it.  I had felt for weeks before I left, while deep into planning food resupply, that all I wanted was to be out there, doing it, and figuring out things I needed to change where I actually was in a position to know those things.  It totally proved true, and as so many others have said, if you're considering it just get out there and do it.  Obviously, plan first.  Go as prepared as you are able.  But don't let fear or anxiety convince you not to take the plunge.
