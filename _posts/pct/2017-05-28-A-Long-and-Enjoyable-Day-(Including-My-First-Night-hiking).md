*Desert Rose? - A bit past bloom, but still very pretty*

Today was a great, but long, day.  I got up somewhere around 6:30 at Mike's, had a quick breakfast, loaded up around 7 liters of water, and took off.  This was another stretch that I knew had nothing but dry or questionable water sources  for about 18 miles, so I wanted to make sure I had plenty.  This was a really good idea since it was up to at least 95 F in the shade by the middle of the day, so I was definitely burning through some water.  I'd really like to stop walking during the day so much, but I inevitably seem to do a lot of hours at the hottest parts of the day.  There's also not much shade ever in most of these stretches, but even less so when the sun is directly overhead.

After I passed Tule Creek (one of the questionable water sources), I took a lunch break in one of the few patches of shade I had seen all day.  As I was sitting there eating, I noticed a mylar umbrella a couple of hills behind me making its way down the trail.  I've only ever seen one umbrella, the one carried by Katie, and the gait seemed to match hers too.  Soon enough, my suspicions were confirmed as she made it to where I was eating lunch.  We talked a little bit about Mike's (and associated weirdness), and how I must have managed to pass her and Joseph (still at Tule Creek) when they took that side trail down to get water.  I had blazed right past it, because I didn't trust it and had just loaded up on water before leaving Mike's.  Katie carried on down the trail, intent on getting to Paradise Valley Cafe to get a burger before they closed, and I sat around eating my lunch a few minutes longer, by which point Joseph came past.  I packed things up and rejoined the trail almost immediately after, and so resumed the leapfrogging of yesterday.

One of the things I've heard frequently about the trail is, "The Trail Provides."  The best instances of trail magic fall into this category in my book, and today was an amazing example.  Right in the midday heat, as I emerged from between some scrub brush to find myself at an intersection with a fire road (are they fire roads? or should it be called something else?), there were a couple of trail angels in a minivan, waiting for all the hikers out in the hot, hot heat.  Joseph and a hiker named Thor (who I had met briefly at Mike's Place) were already there.  Not only were they there on a perfect day, but the spot they had chosen was right before a pretty intense series of climbs, so a break, a patch of shade, and food/drink were just incredible.  This was another example of thru-hiker-turned-trail-angel: Petunia had thru-hiked the PCT last year, and he was there with his girlfriend Christine.  They offered us watermelon and cold Gatorade and Coca-Cola.  They had a couple chairs set up for hikers to sit in, and also had a yoga mat and foam roller if you wanted to try to work out any muscle kinks.  I have no idea what to do with a foam roller, so I skipped out on that one.  So far, at least, I also haven't really had any muscle pains.  The muscle on the back of my leg spanning the knee felt a little bit tight for a bit yesterday, but that has been the extent of it.  I still think it's so incredible there are people like these two who take their time to come out and help out PCT thru-hikers.  It's doubly awesome when its former PCT hikers, as they tend to be really enthusiastic about it (and making sure you succeed), but are also a great wealth of knowledge about the trail.  It's something I would absolutely love to come back and do myself.

After lounging around there with everyone (Katie arrived shortly after me), I took off up the hill before the company, watermelon, and shade sucked me in for good.  After another few hours, I made it to the Sandy Jeep Road cache.  I had heard it often went empty, so I wasn't relying on it, but it was well-stocked when I arrived so I grabbed some water - and drank some water - from there.  I took my second long break of the day in the shade provided by this cache.  I've been trying to get better about taking more, and longer, breaks to split the day and give my feet some time to recover (especially since they were bothering me so much by the end of yesterday).  Thor came along while I was there, which was nice, since he also seemed in no particularly hurry - we spent a good while talking in the shade of the cache.  Eventually Katie arrived (did I mention leapfrogging yet?), and I left about the same time as her but ahead of her as I was moving faster.  A couple miles down the trail, I saw a coyote (first one I've seen while on the trail).  He was looking over his shoulder at me as I came around a corner, and ran off down the trail a bit, stopping to look back again.  Once I got a little closer, he started running again - but this time disappeared almost immediately.

A few more miles down the road was the water cache I had been planning on visiting, a remarkable place called "Walden's".  This cache had several picnic table, a large tank full of water, and a small book library.  It really is a well-run cache (run by Trail Angel Mary), and it really made my day to see books, and jokes about books, out in the middle of nowhere.  There were also cutouts of Thoreau and Walt Whitman, with quotes both relevant and inspiring to those on the PCT.  My favorite though, which I had already heard about thanks to an earlier hiker who blogged about it, was her inclusion in the book box of the poem "Ithaka".  When I first read it thanks to that blogger, it hit me pretty hard as it really does seem to parallel much of why people (myself included) come seeking on the PCT.  Just seeing it in person as I opened the book box, I was almost in tears - I think half from knowing the poem, but half from knowing someone had clearly chosen it specifically for us PCT hikers and taken the time and energy to keep copies of it out there to inspire us (to say nothing of maintaining the whole cache!).

<pre>As you set out for Ithaka
hope the voyage is a long one,
full of adventure, full of disovery.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
angry Poseidon - don't be afraid of them:
you'll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your boy.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
wild Poseidon - you won't encounter them
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.

Hope the voyage is a long one.
May there be a summer morning when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you come into harbors seen for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind -
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you are destined for.
But do not hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you are old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you have gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you would not have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won't have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.
</pre>

I talked to Katie for a good long while at the Walden Cache while I made and ate dinner, and eventually Thor came along and conversation continued anew for a good while.  After still longer, Rooster and Woodchuck and their friends showed up.  I met them briefly back at Walden Springs and they seem pretty cool.  They also have a really great story.  Last year they thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail while dating, this year they're hiking the PCT while engaged, and next year they're planning to do the Continental Divide Trail for their honeymoon.  Thor left around this time to go set up camp about a mile down the road.  Not long after that, a really energetic guy with water dripping off his pack came in.  His name was Eric, he told us, and he had hiked in from highway 74 looking for his friend Josue (Bullet, from earlier).  As was soon revealed, the reason water was dripping off his pack was because he had hiked in ice in order to keep the beers he also hiked in cold.  The Rooster/Woodchuck group had seen Josue earlier in the day and were confident he'd make it there by end-of-day, so Eric stuck around, offered the collected group a beer, and was - I believe - in the process of rolling a joint for same.  It was starting to get late by this point, and I was feeling well-rested, so I said my goodbyes and got back out on the trail because I wanted to get some more miles in.

My plan had been to check out a campsite around 2.6 miles away, and if it was awful (or I was still feeling good) to continue on to one that was about 3.8 miles down the road.  I was feeling good, so I headed down the road to the 3.8 mile "party site" (so nicknamed by us because it could house 6+ tents).  I never even saw it, so I decided to keep going to a single-tent campsite I saw about a mile further.  There is only a sliver of a moon right now, and by this point it was really getting dark, so I busted out my headlamp for my first ever night-hiking.  Sure enough, upon getting to the single-tent campsite, I discovered there was already a single tent set up there.  The couple it belonged to were brushing their teeth and greeted me as I arrived.  That is one thing with campsites - it's very much first-come, first-serve and if it's full when you get there tough luck.  I could have set up next to them (it was actually big enough), but I was still feeling pretty energetic and didn't particularly want to cramp their style.  I also really like camping alone, it's pretty liberating to walk around stark-ass naked outdoors with no-one around to care, and it makes getting ready for bed that much easier.  It also means I don't have to worry about someone else's snoring, or getting up earlier, or having a tent that makes noise all night.  For the record, some of - in particular - the inflatable pads people bring are awful for the noise factor.  Any time they move at all, it causes a horrible squeaky plastic noise.  If I can avoid having to listen to that while trying to get the sleep, I'm all about it.

The only problem was the next campsite was about another 2.6 miles (or roughly an hour) away.  I decided to go for it - I was really enjoying my night-hike so far, free from the oppressive heat I was making better time, feeling great, and drinking less water.  I was pretty cautious about anything sandy-looking (especially near cliff faces) as I didn't want to meet my end that way.  Hiking at night let me see a totally different set of creatures.  There were lots of strange types of spiders and bugs that came out which I had never seen during the day.  The ants are also out in force at night - they're around doing things during the day, but at night there were living ribbons of them moving across the trail between their antholes and various flowers and other things them deemed useful.  Toward the end I did hear coyotes howling to one another.  I reminded myself that I'm far too big for them to want to try to eat me, and - as my headlamp illuminated a rabbit - that there's also plenty of easier prey around.  The coolest thing at night was when a bat swooped in inches over my head directly in front of me, grabbing some insect attracted to the light of my headlamp.  

I did eventually get to a nice little campsite right off the PCT with a bit of shrubbery to make it mostly hidden (not that there was likely to be anyone coming past at 10pm), and I set up my tent and got ready for bed.  Since I was alone, and it wasn't cold, I didn't put on the rain fly.  Best. Decision. Ever.  All night as I drifted to sleep I was able to watch the stars.  Today I made the most miles I've made yet in a day - at just a little over 25 miles.
