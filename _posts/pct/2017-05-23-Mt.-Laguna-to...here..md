So today has easily been my favorite day of hiking so far.  I woke up feeling refreshed from my zero, and got to the trail earlier than I have on any previous day.  Admittedly, I only hit the trail at 8am, which is about two hours after my ideal start time of 6am.  My thinking is that if I leave then, I'll just about be able to do "10 before 10" (ten miles before ten am).

The initial walk out of Mt. Laguna was again through the pine forest, which is really the kind of setting I think of when I think of hiking - a real walk in the woods.  It was a little buggy, but I didn't really feel myself getting bitten or anything, just surrounded by a cloud of little black bugs.  I also deliberately kept my pace moderate, to avoid overexerting myself and feeling totally wiped out and miserable.  I have to say, hiking in that hot midday heat, uphill, in an arid environment the last day into Mt. Laguna really sapped me - and I definitely wasn't having fun by the end of it so much as persevering.  I'm pretty confident I could suffer through the whole trail that way, but it's definitely not what I want to do.

I'm happy to say that today was not that at all.  In large part to my moderate pace, but also an earlier start and a good night's rest, I was *really* loving evey step of today's hike.  I felt a little like John Muir when I caught my silouette, happily ambling along mountain ridges looking down over great valleys, totally at peace with everything.

I did get started once by some military jet taking off, which - in my relative isolation - was so far removed from my thoughts that I momentarily thought, "Oh shit, how is there possibly thunder?".  Another similar moment happened far later when I heard something that sounded like a large bee somewhere near me and getting closer.  After a few moments, I realized it wasn't a bee at all but a dude on a sports bike riding down the highway.  The last strange moment like this was when I heard some guy on a harley coming down the highway at a different spot, blasting music.  It just seemed so wildly obnoxious when I had been hiking through such serene, quiet land - and got me thinking, "What the hell do all the forest creatures make of this nonsense?"

At one point in the hills leaving Laguna, I came around a corner only to look to my left and see a snake perfectly camoflauged in the grass inches off the PCT.  I don't think I startled him (he didn't move at all, he was probably in post-meal bliss), but he sure as hell startled me.  I jumped several inches to the right before hustling my way past him and keeping a lookout for any more snakes lurking in the grass.

It was a good thing I checked the water report this morning, because a picnic area I had been planning on getting water recently was updated to reflect that the water was off.  It would have been a real mess to get there and find out I had to backtrack to get more water, and as it turned out the water source I was planning on bypassing or only getting a minimal amount of water from was actually a really nice, really cold water source.  I also made my first PCT Water Report contribution, since the last update at that water source was over a week old and suggested that it may be running out soon.

I'm really feeling at home out here, and just genuinely happy.  Even though it can be incredibly hard work, it's also incredibly satisfying, and so far I've been quite lucky that I haven't encountered any bad weather or bad luck.  One thing I've noticed is that just about everyone who is out on the trail seems to be really enjoying life, including the day-hikers who are doing some of the tough sections of the trail. I think there's just a type of person who enjoys being out in nature, challenged physically, and finds it truly restorative.  It's certainly how I'm feeling right about now.  This type of person also isn't limited strictly to hikers.  Today I met a man named James who was hanging out in his van at a nice lookout, talking to hikers going by and giving out water.  He seemed totally at peace with the world, and from where I'm sitting it seemed like a pretty damn good life.  Drive around camping at gorgeous spots, talking to people, and just generally living life free.  If anyone says the hippie is dead, I would point to people like James to say "No, the hippie lives on, hidden in the beautiful remote places in this country, doing his own thing, and living life as freely as possible."

I met a couple of hikers at the last water supply I hit today, a pretty grody, algae-filled cistern barely fit for horses - but plenty good for thru-hikers.  While there, I met Vladimir, who was filling up water.  Earlier in the day, at the picnic site without water, I met Katie.  She was taking a break when I arrived, and I did the same, taking my shoes off and lying on a picnic table in the shade for a bit before continuing on.  I saw her again at the horse trough where I met Vladimir.  I was feeling ambitious, so I left there after having dinner, thinking I'd keep booking on down the trail, but I only made it a few miles before I decided to call it for the night.  Now I'm camped in a little spot alongside the trail just over 20 miles outside of Mt. Laguna.  I feel filthier than ever, but also increasingly happy and just *relaxed*.  I'm not going crazy and pushing myself super-hard anymore, and I'm taking more time to appreciate the sights, the birds flying around, and just how wonderful it is to be able to be out here doing this.

I'm happy to report I've been stopping and eating food along the trail now, and that I'm actually craving it rather than having to force it down.  The propel was also a really good idea - I had some and it made me feel a million times better.  I think I should start trying to keep a good log of how much water I drink, because I feel like I'm drinking a ton (today I had...6 liters I think?), but I still feel dehydrated.  At the risk of getting a little TMI, my pee is a pretty vibrant yellow by the end of the day, and there's not a lot of it.  By all accounts, I feel like I'm drinking more than the average, but I know I'm a thirsty (and sweaty) dude.  Another thing I'm theorizing is that using a bladder with a tube rather than just stopping to drink water is making me drink less.  Since I can't actually see how much I have left, I'm probably being overly careful rationing it, and it's also just slower to drink than chugging water out of a bottle.  I know when I stopped at the picnic area I pounded down half a liter in seconds, stopping myself from having any more so I didn't just have a water balloon in my stomach.  Similarly, when I stopped to take a break and had that propel, I downed the whole liter in seconds knowing that I'd sit there for a while to let it settle.  I should probably - at the very least - get a new platypus hose that is longer, so it's easier to drink from.  I cut it to length (plus some) when I installed the Sawyer quickfill valve for it, but after the first day realized I wasn't getting half the water in my bladder because of gravity and a bunch of gear being pressed up against the bag.  So, I flipped it so the valve is at the bottom of the bag like it probably always should have been, but it means the tube is so short I have to turn my head to drink from it and look at the trail out of the corner of my eye.  Not ideal.

To end the day, as I was sitting here in my tent, I heard a couple of people hiking up the trail.  It turned out to be none other than Jet and Mike (shit, I hope that's his name, I'm so bad with names), who had gotten a later start than I thought from talking with Katie, and they were about ready to call it quits for the day so they camped out here too for the night  Here I was thinking they were miles on down the trail.
