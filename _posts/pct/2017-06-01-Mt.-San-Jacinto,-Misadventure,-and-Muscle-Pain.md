I feel stuck trying to begin to write this post, because today was a very complicated day where I went from feeling fantastic to feeling absolutely crushed.  As has been the approach so far, I'm just going to write it in my rambling, roughly chronological style and talk about the good and the bad at the times where they occurred in the day. 

The day started off wonderfully.  I really loved the town of Idyllwild, and woke up feeling well-rested but ready to get back on the trail.  I could still feel a little soreness in my left thigh, but it was way better than it had been and I was able to fully raise my leg to my chest (which I hadn't been able to do when I first arrived in town).  As is usual - at least for me - I ended up leaving town later than I had intended.  In Idyllwild, this was due to the combination of trying to figure out where I wanted to resupply, doing last minute food tweaks, and just going to bed later than intended the night before due to reorganizing a bunch of things in my pack.  One benefit of my late start was that the room with the hiker boxes was accessible, so I was able to drop off the knife I'd picked up (Army of One!) along with some extra food that I didn't need.  I also scoured the boxes for anything useful, and found a lightweight carabiner, which is something I'd actually been looking for as an easy way to secure my hat / headlamp to the pack when not in use.  I saw a nice section of platypus hose in the hiker box at the outfitter, which had an in-line shut-off valve.  I meant to pick it up, but totally forgot about it - not a huge deal, as I've been considering sending my platypus bladder/hose system home anyway, and I just convinced myself that it's just one more thing that could have broken.  I also would not have started drinking water out of a hose of unknown history without cleaning it with bleach, so I wasn't just going to go grab it the morning I was leaving.  That's more than I intended to write about that stupid platypus hose, that I didn't even take.

In keeping with my decision to leave a continuous footpath, I walked through Idyllwild until I reached the trailhead of the Ernie Maxwell trail.  This trail was noted on what I've taken to calling the "official unofficial" detour around the section of PCT closed by the 2013 fire as an option to get out of town.  It added an extra mile compared to walking along the road, but I decided I'd rather take a nice trail through the woods (I read some reviews of it before setting out) than dodge any more oversized mirrors from asshole towtruck drivers, so my decision was pretty easily made.  It turned out to be a good decision, too, as the Ernie Maxwell trail was certainly as described.  The trail was almost entirely in the shade of pine trees, with numerous small stream crossings, and was gently graded and covered in duff - making it a very pleasant, and low-impact, start to my day.

There were several locals out walking their dogs on the trail, and all of them were quite pleasant.  One woman stopped me as I passed, to let me know that the ranger at Humber Park (where I was headed, the end of the far end of the Ernie Maxwell trail) had seen a bear hanging out around the park.  My thoughts on bears are pretty divided - on the one hand, I feel like a bear is the first creature I may see that could potentially decide to attack me and do a good job of it; on the other hand, I know the chance of that happening is very rare, and it would be really cool to see a bear in person.  At any rate, I whipped out my phone and refreshed my memory on the appropriate actions to take when seeing a bear.  For the record: screaming, running, climbing a tree, or growling at a bear - all bad ideas.  Talking calmly to it, making sure it has an escape route, and walking sideways relative to it - good plans.

*Start of San Jacinto Wilderness*

Before too long, I made it to Humber Park, where I walked up several uphill curves of road before meeting up with the Devil's Slide trail.  I know Idyllwild is popular with climbers, and I'm unsure if "Devil's Slide" refers to some feature off the trail at some point that climbers like, but after hiking it I've decided it refers to the trail itself.  It's a pretty steep, rocky trail all the way up, so thinking of it as the "Devil's Slide" seems fairly fitting.  At this point in the day, I was still feeling great.  On the Devil's Slide trail, I met a few locals coming down, along with a group of three hikers.  One of them was wearing a giant, black Pink Floyd t-shirt...I love Pink Floyd, but you wouldn't catch me wearing a heavy-ass, water-absorbing cotton shirt while doing this sort of hiking, especially in black.  The only unpleasant person I met was a fit young woman wearing matching designer workout gear.  She stepped off the trail to let me pass, and I said hello and thanked her as I passed.  She said nothing, fiddled with some gadget on her arm, and then took off down the hill again.  I guess my passing must have messed up her times on fitbit or strava or whatever the hot, new thing is now for tracking your workouts.  It just made me laugh, because little delays like that have been reduced to nothingness when the plan is to hike about 2650 miles.

At the top of Devil's Slide, I rejoined the PCT.  There were a couple of dayhikers taking a break before heading to the summit, and one PCT thru-hiker who headed up shortly before me.  After a short snack, I continued up the trail without seeing anyone for a while, though I did see my first snow on the PCT.

A short while later, I made it to the junction where the PCT splits and goes around Mt. San Jacinto, and another trail goes up to the summit.  One notable thing, snow!  In Idyllwild, I had debated whether to go up to the summit (an extra mile, and lots of elevation), but pretty quickly decided too.  I read that it was the second-highest peak in Southern California, and it seemed like it would be a shame to miss that.  Then I read that John Muir said, Â "The view from San Jacinto is the most sublime spectacle to be found anywhere on this earth!"  Well, if I had any doubts, that certainly settled it.

*San Jacinto Peak Trailhead*

The trail up Mt. San Jacinto was a pretty steep, rocky trail with a lot of large, awkward, or at times large and awkward steps.  At some point during the ascent, the muscles on my inner left thigh (the adductors, I'm fairly certain) began to hurt again.  I wasn't happy about this, as I'd thought they were feeling really good when I left Idyllwild, but apparently they were still a bit weak.  The hours of steep uphill I'd already done most certainly didn't do recovery any favors.  Once I realized it was starting to hurt me, I made sure to try to shift most of the hard and awkward steps to my right leg instead.  This meant I would lead with my right foot on any large steps, so it had the burden of pulling my body uphill.  Similarly, whenever there were awkward steps that it was possible to take with my right foot - I would.  This slowed my pace a bit, as I'd sometimes have to break stride to lead with my right foot, but I was still feeling good overall.  It actually became something of a game for me, as I recalled doing hurdles back in high school - where a large part of being fast was ensuring your stride was correct so that you were lined up to jump each hurdle properly without having to correct your position before the jump (slowing yourself in the process).  Needless to say, it's harder to do when it's uneven terrain with randomly spaced obstacles.

I didn't take a single break on the ascent up the trail to the summit to Mt. San Jacinto, and honestly - leg notwithstanding - I was feeling incredible.  I passed a few people who were taking breaks, short of breath, including one guy who got embarrassed a  bit because his wife called out, "at least you didn't throw up!" before realizing I was there.  In contrast, I felt like I could just keep climbing indefinitely at the pace I was going, with my 30+ lbs. on my back, and it would just never become an issue.  Well, I would have felt that way entirely if it wasn't for my left leg.  It was definitely hurting by the time I got to the top, but it still was mostly a dull sort of pain, and by leading with my right leg it seemed to be quite manageable.  The trail up to the summit was mostly well-marked, but there were a few sections where lingering snow, downed trees, etc. meant it became a bit obscured and I had to stop several times briefly to look for a cairn or other indicator to make sure I was still headed the right way.

*Interior of the shelter*

Right near the summit, there is a very nice shelter that was built in 1933.  I was surprised to find that it was unlocked, and even more (pleasantly) surprised to find that it was in good shape.  I guess the sort o people who decide to climb up past 10,000 ft. aren't the sort of people who would vandalize such a thing.  This is really good, as even when I got there around 4pm there was a breeze and it was a bit chilly.  I imagine that on a less pleasant day (or indeed, just about any day earlier in the season), that shelter could be life-saving.  In many ways, us backpackers have a pretty big advantage if we find ourselves in an unexpected situation - we have extra layers, extra clothes, tents, sleeping bags, extra food and water, and the means to purify found water.  If a day-hiker ended up there near sunset, with winds picking up and temperatures dropping, having a warm shelter (including medical supplies, non-perishable food, and sleeping bags!) could be a godsend.

I saw the thru-hiker I had seen briefly just past the top of Devil's Slide sitting outside the shelter, and talked to him for a bit.  His name is Alex, he's Australian, and a pretty cool - and relaxed - guy.  We both ditched our packs, and did the last little ascent to the very peak of Mt. San Jacinto, which was more of a scramble than a trail.  Unfortunately, it was a pretty cloudy day so it fell a bit short of the "most sublime spectacle," but it was still quite nice.  It also made me appreciate -as I briefly mentioned earlier - just how much stronger I have gotten since beginning the trail.

*Panorama from the peak of Mt. San Jacinto*

I didn't linger long at the top, as it was already later in the day than I had hoped (a combination of my late start, and slower pace due to my injured leg), and as I began my descent down the second half of the Mt. San Jacinto peak trail to rejoin the PCT, the real fun began.  You know how just sentences ago I was talking about how strong I felt, even with my injured leg?  Nevermind all that.  Within a mile of the descent, I was feeling awful.  Every single step on my leg caused a new burst of pain, and after a few miles traveled down the rocky, steep grade it was becoming quite painful and I was becoming quite slow.  I cursed myself for leaving Idyllwild rather than taking a second zero, as clearly my leg needed more time to recover.  I think it might have been ok if the terrain was more moderate, but the steep, rocky trails I was on were clearly too much, too soon.  Dispersed camping is not allowed in the San Jacinto wilderness, and I had miles to go before I would clear the boundary, so I gritted my teeth and pressed on.  Not too far down the trail is the Little Round Valley, which has a number of official campsites.  It also provided a brief reprieve from the steep, rocky trail as it leveled out here and was generally duff-covered paths with only small rocks to contend with.  My leg started feeling a little better as a result, and so - combined with my own stubbornness and limited food supply - I decided to press on and try to make it to the good water source (North Fork of the San Jacinto River, which crosses the PCT shortly after I'd rejoin it from my descent down from Mt. San Jacinto) I had planned on stopping at to take dinner.  I figured once I took a break and had dinner, spending some time off my leg, I'd be able to press on to the wilderness border.  

![Stream near Little Round Valley](/assets/img/posts/0601_sjstream.jpg)
*Stream near Little Round Valley*

As I left the Little Round Valley campsites, the trail once again became really steep and rocky, and my leg was now at a point where I was basically doing Lamaze breathing through clenched teeth in order to keep going.  It was around here that my mood had really switched pretty drastically.  The entire way up I had been in high spirits, glad to be back on the trail, and just feeling great about everything.  Now, I began to start to doubt myself.  I should have stayed in Idyllwild longer.  I should have stopped at the campsites at Little Round Valley for the night, or the shelter at the top of the mountain.  It really dawned on me that there was also no easy out.  My next planned stop was Big Bear City, a good five days away at a normal pace for me - and it was pretty clear if my leg was this bad each day I was never going to be keeping a normal pace.  That meant it would take longer, and then I'd be running out of food.  It would also take me longer to get the distances between water sources, so that would mean I'd have to carry more water, which would increase the strain on my injured leg.  None of this was sounding good, and it was getting me pretty frustrated and disappointed with myself and my decisions.

This was soon amplified.  At one point shortly before veering away from the North Fork of the San Jacinto river, the trail down to the PCT appeared to have a branch that went toward the North Fork instead of away from it.  I knew the correct trail actually went away, but I was in so much pain by this point that I decided to take the trail that went down to the water.  It was a pretty official-looking trail (large rocks edging the pathway down, clearly placed there to mark the trail), but it pretty quickly became apparent that it was no longer supposed to be a usable trail  A number of downed trees were across it, and before long it was full of loose rocks.  I had started down the trail, as one might say, "accidentally on purpose" hoping that it would cut the corner a bit and save me maybe a mile of walking on my leg, which was now so weak that it was quivering with each step.  After I had only gone a short distance down the trail, I did consider stopping and going back uphill to take the proper trail...but I'll be honest, my leg was so weak and in such pain that I didn't even think I'd be capable of doing it, at least not without it taking a painful eternity.

So, I continued down the remnants of this trail until I got to the North Fork of the San Jacinto river, probably a quarter mile uphill of where it would eventually cross the PCT.  I had decided that, whatever I did next, I absolutely needed to get off my leg for a while - so I took my pack off and set about filtering water for the next leg of the journey and making dinner.  With my slow progress, it was now right around 7pm, so it was not the long, relaxing dinner I had really been hoping for.  Especially with being off the PCT, my thoughts turned toward what would become of me if some misfortune befell me.  Since there was noone nearby, and noone likely to come offtrail as I had, I didn't expect anyone would stumble upon me.  I was also thinking, "gee, it's probably right around the time other animals might come down to the river to drink themselves", so I was on-guard in case I found myself at the favorite spot of a bear or mountain lion.  With the wind, elevation, shade, and setting sun it was also beginning to get chilly.  Dipping my hands into the icy river to collect water didn't help that any.  I filtered my water as fast as I could, inhaled my (still-crunchy) rice and beans, and repacked my stuff to head out.  But what was the plan now?  In the next of a series of questionable decisions rooted in my pain, I decided to follow the river down to where it met the PCT.  I looked at the topo maps, and it didn't look like the grade would be too steep, and from what I could see there wasn't any section where the stream was lined by cliffs or something similar that would make it impassable.  As I headed south along the river, looking forward to rejoining the PCT before sunset, everything was going well (though I was still hurting a bit, and pretty pissed off at myself for deciding to go off-trail in general, both for making myself hard to find and because it's not in keeping with Leave No Trace).

I climbed a tiny hill, and found myself able to look down at the PCT.  Great, I'm almost there.  Only one problem, the last 100 ft. or so were pretty steep, and covered in slippery duff and snow.  There were also four people taking a break and collecting water where the river crossed the PCT, as I had intended to.  An audience to the culmination of my series of fuckups that brought me to the top of this hillside, fantastic.  One of them was Alex, too, so clearly I'm recognized.  I couldn't hear them, and they couldn't hear me, but I did get a question in the form of a gesture to make sure I was ok.  I gave my best doofy thumbs-up, and turned my attention to how best to get down the hill.  I knew injury here would be a real mess, and I took my sweet time figuring out the best route down.  I backtracked slightly once, but otherwise was able to just take it one step at a time, prodding each footstep with my hiking sticks (the ever-useful hiking sticks) to make sure it was secure, and using the odd large rock and downed limb to safely navigate my way to the bottom.  Adrenaline is a hell of a thing, because my leg wasn't hurting me at all during that descent, so focused was I on getting down safely and on my embarrassment for having an audience to my bad decisions.  I was happy to see Alex had delayed leaving until I got down, and I thanked him for doing so, as it sure would have been nice had something happened to have someone able to do something about it.  He moved on down the trail once I was down, in my mind clearly seeking to distance himself from this embarrassing, inexperienced, LNT-violating hiker, but quite possibly just going at his normal pace as I resumed my painful hobble along the trail.

Before long it started to get dark, and I was still several miles from the edge of the San Jacinto wilderness.  This is where I was feeling the worst of the day.  I was still in incredible, and once again growing, pain, and was back to traveling on steep, rocky downhill path - slowing my pace to an absolute crawl.  I realized I was never going to make it to the border with my current leg, and decided I'd at least try to make it to one of the campsites marked on Guthook so I'd at least prevent more transgressions of LNT for the day by using a pre-existing campsite.  I hobbled in there about 20 minutes after sunset, absolutely wrecked, and feeling like a complete idiot.  I pushed on when I should have rested longer, I pushed on when I should have taken a break, I went off-trail and down a potentially dangerous hill, and now I was camping inside an area you weren't supposed to camp miles away from the nearest opportunity to get off the trail.  For the first time, I was feeling like I should get off the trail because I was unqualified to be on it (as opposed to any thoughts of the physical challenge of the trail), and was really disappointed in myself for deciding against just stopping and setting up camp for the night at Little Round Valley or down near the river where I'd had dinner.  I let my pain and stubbornness guide my decisions, trying to push through when the objectively better decision would have been to just get some rest and start fresh the next morning.  It's easily the worst I've ever felt about myself on the trail, and about doing the PCT in general.

As an aside, one thing that was interesting to me is that I ended up camping right next to another guy, who had arrived there exhausted and set up camp as well, even though it was inside the boundary.  I'd read about thru-hikers acting like we can just flash our permit like, "It's ok, I'm a thru-hiker." as though rules don't apply to us, and there definitely can be a bit of that attitude out here on the trail.  This was probably one good example of it.  The other, more surprising thing to me, is that at least half the hikers I talked to weren't even aware it wasn't an area where dispersed camping isn't permitted, and any camping requires a permit.  It's on the half-mile app, it's printed on the half-mile maps, it's posted when you first enter the wilderness area, so...at least in some ways I'm doing ok as far as preparation / planning.  It's also interesting to me that Guthook's shows several campsites inside the boundary - I'd assume the logic (which I followed) is that they already exist, so by using them you avoid destroying any other areas, but it is a little odd to see them included since they're technically illegal.
