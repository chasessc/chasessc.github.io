Well, I'm really glad that I took a zero here at Mt. Laguna, though it does make me see how it could be pretty easy to get sucked off-trail for a longer period if you aren't careful (or really aren't feeling the hike).  I lounged around most of the morning, only going out to get some gatorade, cactus cooler (an orange-pineapple soda I think I'm now in love with), and a couple things I wanted for the next leg of my hike (more ziplocs, propel powder).  I also rummaged through the hiker box there, and snagged some hard cinnamon candy and all but the first of the half-mile maps from here to Warner Springs.  That was a really nice find for me, because I like having paper maps as a backup but had forgotten (in my frantic last-minute prep.) to put the relevant section in my Mt. Laguna box.  After that, I did some basic chores: backflushed my Sawyer, reorganized and tidied up gear, and did laundry.  I don't think I truly appreciated just how dirty I'd gotten in a few days until I saw the filthy water that came off those clothes.  Really, this was mostly from just two days too - I rinsed my clothes pretty thoroughly when I took a shower at Lake Morena.

Some time after noon, I went to check out the Mt. Laguna Supply store - which was quite a scene.  A number of hikers were hanging out outside, weighing and repacking their packs after changing out gear, and the inside was - as one comment put it - "like Ali Baba's cave."  Totally jam-packed with gear.  I opted to get a Therm-a-rest Z-Lite (small), since I really didn't want the expense or hassle of an air mattress, didn't want to chance puncturing one, and like the idea of being able to flop my pad down anywhere to take a break.  I'm going to keep my ThinLight pad as well, since it weighs only a few ounces and will provide that much more padding and insulation.  One thing that was suggested to me was just doing away with a groundcloth and using the pad as a groundcloth, but I'm not ready to do that yet.  I'd be a bit worried about it not covering the whole tent floor, but mostly my groundcloth is designed for the tent so I can do the "fast-fly" setup.  Admittedly, I haven't used that yet, but I think (especially if I want to nap midday) that being able to (relatively) quickly create a shady spot along the trail will be pretty nice.

Shortly before five, I headed to the Lodge Store to donate a whole lot of food to the hiker box there.  As I said, I really just haven't been eating as much as I thought I would per day, and I packed two much food initially and in my Mt. Laguna box, so probably about half of it went to the box.  Lots of fig bars, a few dinners, a vega shake, and at least one bag each of mixed dried fruit and trail mix.  Hopefully it's of use to someone, but "mystery food bags" (I saw a bunch of others) are probably a harder sell than the clearly-labeled, pre-packaged things.  If I had to rank things in order of likelihood they're picked up, I'd wager: fig bars, trail mix, fruit mix, rice & beans, shake mix, corn chowder.

*Food for the Hiker Box*

After dropping that food off, I headed back to the Supply Store to see about a better system to solve my shallow-water woes.  The owner suggested a nice little handheld MSR filter / pump, but I didn't really want to replace my Sawyer so much as get a better method of getting water through it.  He suggested using a piece of a plastic bottle as a scoop or funnel (something I'd already heard) or cutting the bottom off a Sawyer bag and using that.  The store literally had an entire hiker box full of nothing but Sawyer bags and accessories (guess I'm not the first person who'se had issues with them), and I managed to find a 2 liter bag to use for this purpose.  As I'm writing this, the only thing I'm now realizing I wish I had grabbed was one of the nozzle-style attachments, so I could easily regulate the flow of water out of it once it's filled, rather than having to clench the bottom shut while unscrewing the cap and pouring water into my intact Sawyer bags.  It's late for me to want to go back there now and find one (assuming the boxes are left outside after-hours), and I did test pouring it after filling it and it wasn't bad.  I'll keep my eyes peeled for one in future hiker boxes (though I doubt many will be as full as that one). ...maybe I'll take a walk down there tonight or early tomorrow and see, it does sound like it would make it simpler and easier to avoid spilling water.

After stopping by the Supply Store for the second time in a day, I headed to the Pine House Cafe with dreams of another salad and a big serving of fries.  I swear their salad is really good, though I do wonder if it's heightened by being the first fresh thing I'd eaten in a few days.  I got a gentle reminder about planning and dependence when I got there to find that not only did it close at 3pm on Mondays, but they had a family emergency so it wasn't actually open at all today.  I hope everything is all right.

For me, it's just meant that my dreamed-of dinner isn't happening, and now I'm eating whatever excess I have for dinner.  Since I gave away pretty much all my extra food to the store hiker box shortly before they were closed, I had no chance to go reclaim one dinner.  So dinner so far has been the remainder of the bag of tortilla chips I bought earlier and some hard cinnamon candy.  Thankfully, I did leave myself a double breakfast - so I'll probably make the shake tonight and have that.  I'm not really feeling very hungry after all those tortillas chips, but it's not exactly the most balanced dinner.  If nothing else, having the shake tonight will make my morning prep. that much easier.

*Sleeping Pads*

That's the bulk of my gear, ready to be packed in the morning.  My sleeping bag is already in the pack, where it lives at the bottom.  Everything pictured is basically laid out left to right in order of what goes in first.  My tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL1), in the orange bag, goes into my pack on top of my sleeping bag (less the poles, which I keep in the outside elastic pouch).  Stuffed next to that are generally the sleeping bag liner (pale blue bag) and groundcloth (small grey bag).  After that, I put in my Ursack (food) against the back of the pack, and behind it place the next three stuff sacks, containing: a second set of hiking clothes, sleep clothes, and weather-dependent clothes (rain jacket, bug net, wind/rain pants).  I've been keeping my warm jacket strapped to the back of my pack so I can don an extra layer if it gets cold or rainy (it's water-resistant).  Above that goes my food soaking "pot" (the gatorade powder jar), just because it if gets crushed the lid will pop off, along with things I want easy access to while hiking - the rain cover for my pack (small green bag), first aid ziploc, and water filtration stuff.  Not pictured are my "tech bag" with phone chargers, keyboard, etc.  I tend to keep it toward the top in no particular location, just so it doesn't get crushed.  I also have been keeping my bag of half-mile maps toward the top, but there's no particular reason for this either - mostly, like the tech. bag, it's just to help keep the maps from getting totally mangled.  On the top of the pack (outside, strapped down) I'll keep both sleeping pads.  In the shoulder strap pocket, I keep my spade, hand sanitizer, lip balm, washcloth, and pocketknife.  In the right hipbelt pocket I keep my phone, the current half-mile map, and the PCT water report.  In the left hipbelt pocket, I keep some snacks for munching on during the day and any short break (just a couple of any kind of bar - clif, lara, fig - along with a bag of granola.  As I've said in the past, I've really had to force myself to eat something on the trail.  I also now added some propel powder there, so I can replenish some electrolytes during the day.  I always intended to keep gatorade for that purpose, but I forgot to pack it.  Thankfully, they had something similar here because I'm worried (maybe overly so) about drinking too much water without salts leading to hyponatremia.

The reason my pack isn't packed tonight is because I put my platypus bag (normally along the back of the pack, in a pouch) in the fridge so I'll start the day with ice cold water.  I also put 2 smartwater bottles in the freezer, using as they melt I'll continue to have glorious, cold water.  I'm planning on leaving early tomorrow, for real this time, so I'm going to go hit the sack.
