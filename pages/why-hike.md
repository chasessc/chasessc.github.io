# Why Hike?
Around seven months ago, I stumbled my way across [*a PCTA post by Zach Davis*](https://www.pcta.org/2016/single-biggest-mistake-made-preparing-thru-hike-38250/) that focused on the importance mental preparation plays in successfully completing a thru-hike. As stated in the article, "[n]eglectig to prepare your mind for a thru-hike is a mistake of epic proportions."  I ended up buying the book he co-authored, [*Pacific Crest Trials*](http://appalachiantrials.com/pacific-crest-trials/), which recommends answering three important questions prior to a thru-hike attempt in order to solidify the reasons for your hike, results if successful, and repercussions if you fail.  The primary goal of the answers is to help yourself remain motivated on the trail - even when your gear is troublesome, the weather is horrid, and your feet are more blister than skin.  This post is my attempt to answer these questions.

## I am thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail because...
...in October of 2015, I realized just how unhappy and unhealthy I had become and quit my stable, well-paying job as a "Senior Software Systems Engineer" at a company that prides itself on its work-life balance.  Problematically, I was no longer excited by the work, hated the workplace politics, and lacked the full life that could have served as balance. If I wasn't working, odds were I was sitting in my apartment alone playing videogames or watching endless movies, drinking too much, and keeping my streak as a foodler gold member running thanks to a diet of delivery food and unhealthy snacks from the corner market.  In the months preceding my departure, I often thought about what would make me happy (buy a house? see more live music? get a girlfriend? settle with getting a dog?), but grew to realize none of these would serve as more than a temporary distraction from my deep-seated unhappiness.  As I put it in my farewell to coworkers, "I am ready for a change - of scenery, of work, of lifestyle."

After quitting, I moved to the Sierra Foothills in California to be closer to family both immediate and extended.  While here, I have taken time to explore some of my passions, eat healthier, and be more physically active.  I took courses at a local community college on topics that interested me and hadn't fit into my Computer Science curriculum, volunteered (and eventually worked) at a farmed animal sanctuary, rediscovered my love of reading, and spent many hours of every week hiking.  As I began to feel better physically and mentally, and my savings steadily drained, I started to think "what now?"

On my 30th birthday, spent solo hiking in Yosemite, the answer became apparent - do one long hike before rejoining the "real world" and looking for a job (or at least something sustainable more long-term).  Ever since I hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail with my New Jersey Boy Scout troop, I had dreamed of one day hiking the entire trail.  After witnessing the true awesomeness of Yosemite, and reveling in the fact that I lived on the West Coast now, I decided the answer was to hike the Pacific Crest Trail instead.  If I enjoy it as much as I anticipate, perhaps then it will be time to hike the Appalachian Trail.


## When I successfully thru-hike the Pacific Crest Trail, I will...
* have spent months exploring my inner thoughts and unraveling my issues and insecurities.
* have met interesting people from all walks of life, and myriad nationalities.
* have learned a large amount about backpacking.
* have learned a large amount about things other than backpacking.
* be in the best shape of my life.
* be a more flexible person.
* be more confident and happy with who I am, as who I am more closely resembles who I want to be.
* know with more certainly what I want to do next in life.
* have culminated my time away from the professional / working world with a meaningful and explainable endeavor.  Thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is something I expect to be able to point to as demonstrable proof of my research and planning abilities, self-sufficiency, adaptability, and follow-through.
* have one hell of a story.

## If I give up on the Pacific Crest Trail, I will...  
* be incredibly disappointed in myself.
* feel that I have let down those who encouraged and supported me, even if they insist otherwise.
* have to find a job without a capstone to my time away.
* be stuck eating months worth of pop-tarts, clif bars, and dehydrated food.
* likely become very depressed.
