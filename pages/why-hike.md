# Why Hike?
Around seventh months ago, I stumbled my way across [*a PCTA post by Zach Davis*](https://www.pcta.org/2016/single-biggest-mistake-made-preparing-thru-hike-38250/) that focused on the importance mental preparation plays in successfully completing a thru-hike. As stated in the article, "[n]eglectig to prepare your mind for a thru-hike is a mistake of epic proportions."  I ended up buying the book he co-authored, [*Pacific Crest Trials*](Pacific Crest Trials), which recommends answering three important questions prior to a thru-hike attempt in order to solidify the reasons for your hike, results if successful, and repercussions if you fail.  The primary goal of the answers is to help yourself remain motivated on the trail - even when your gear is troublesome, the weather is horrid, and your feet are more blister than skin.  This post is my attempt to answer these questions.

## I am thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail because...

## When I successfully thru-hike the Pacific Crest Trail, I will...

## If I give up on the Pacific Crest Trail, I will...
